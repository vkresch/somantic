# Somantic

The goal of [Somantic](https://www.somantic.net/apps/covsom/) is to enable scientists a faster visual content based search and exploration through the COVID-19 related literature. It can be used in creating an associative search method so that one may position a new paper on a map and find the closely related texts in the neighborhood of the research literature landscape. By clustering papers based on their contextual similarity scientists can identify on a glance papers which discuss similar topics. Somantic can also be used as a plagiarism detection tool by identifying papers which are closely related.

Somantic is a privately developed project. The project was started because of Kaggle's [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). It was inspired by Teuvo Kohonen's [WEBSOM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231298000393). Timo Honkela worked also on the WEBSOM and wrote an interesting [thesis](http://users.ics.aalto.fi/tho/thesis/) about the usage of self-organizing maps in natural language processing.

**DISCLAIMER**: The app is currently in prototype phase and will be slow for loading graphics or responding to inputs especially when many users are connected. Based on the feedback from user and demand I will improve Somantic's performance and implement many more features. For feature requests and bug reporting please use this github repository. Thanks for checking out Somantic.
